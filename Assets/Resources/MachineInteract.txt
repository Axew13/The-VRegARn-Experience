The factory is now producing tofu and oat milk! This is much more sustainable.
By the way, did you know that while cow's milk only lasts about a week, oat milk can last years? It doesn't even need to be refridgerated!
You can make your own oat milk - but commercial oat milk is enriched with Vitamin D - and also Vitamin B12, which you would normally get from beef.
Well, that's everything I have to teach you for now. Goodbye!
Oh, and if you're done with the AR Paper, remember to recycle it!
